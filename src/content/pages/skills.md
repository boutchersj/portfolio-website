## QA Automation

I specialize in building end-to-end test automation solutions from scratch.

Web apps, APIs, native apps, mobile apps, I do it all. I enjoy using my superpowers to write money-saving code so developers can write more money-making code.

My preferred stack is **Playwright** and **TypeScript**, but I've also worked with **WebdriverIO**, **appium**, and **pytest**, among others.

## DevOps

On the DevOps side of QA, I've used solutions like **Azure DevOps Pipelines** and **GitHub Actions** to build pipelines that deliver a top-notch test-running & test-debugging experience via **bash** scripts, pipeline variables, and artifact uploads.

## Web Development

I learned full-stack web development using self-paced resources like freeCodeCamp, Scrimba, and Udemy back in 2017-2019.

At my first QA job, my team was spending a lot of time gathering real shopping receipts to use for test scenarios, because taking photos of receipts was the main feature of the app under test.

I used **React** to build a tool that generated fake receipt images. Last time I checked, it's still being used across the entire Engineering org by QA, Dev, and Product to try out new receipt scenarios.

Aside from building internal web apps, my web dev skills have come in handy for adding test ids, fixing small bugs, and reviewing PRs. I'm also familiar with **Vue**, **Svelte**, and **Astro** from personal projects.
